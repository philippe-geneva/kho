    Please note that this is a beta service, as such, it is not authoritative and the full content of the Global Health Observatory database is not yet available through these functions.  
     <p />
Many of these datasets represent the best estimates of WHO using methodologies for specific indicators that aim for comparability across countries and time; they are updated as more recent or revised data become available, or when there are changes to the methodology being used. Therefore, they are not always the same as official national estimates, although WHO whenever possible will provide Member States the opportunity review and comment on data and estimates as part of country consultations. Please check the Indicator and Measurement Registry for indicator specific information.
