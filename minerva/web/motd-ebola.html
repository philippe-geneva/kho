    <b>Disclaimer</b>
    <p>
      This data set represents the best estimates of WHO using methodologies for 
      specific indicators that aim for comparability across countries and time; they 
      are updated as more recent or revised data become available, or when there 
      are changes to the methodology being used. Therefore, they are not always the 
      same as official national estimates, although WHO whenever possible will 
      provide Member States the opportunity to review and comment on data and 
      estimates as part of country consultations. Note that these numbers are subject
      to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and 
      availability of laboratory results.

      Please check the Indicator and Measurement Registry for indicator specific information.
