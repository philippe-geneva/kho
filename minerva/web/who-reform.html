  <h1>Welcome to the WHO Reform Implementation Plan</h1>
    <p>The WHO reform implementation plan browser reflects the current status of the different reform proposals. The system is updated on a regular basis. It provides details of outcomes and outcome indicators, outputs, key deliverables, and budgets at the output level. 
Over the last two years, Member States have endorsed over 40 specific proposals in the three broad areas of reform – programmes and priorities, governance and management – through adoption of governing body resolutions and decisions. Several other proposals are currently under discussion. A comprehensive, detailed and budgeted implementation plan for WHO reform is the basis for managing change, monitoring progress, and mobilizing resources to finance the proposed reform activities.</p>

<p>The objectives of WHO reform are:<br/>
<ul class="list_dash">
<li>Improved health outcomes, with WHO meeting the expectations of its Member States and partners in addressing agreed global health priorities, focused on the actions where the Organization has a unique function or comparative advantage, and financed in a way that facilitates this focus</li>
<li>Greater coherence in global health with WHO playing a leading role in enabling the many different actors to play an active and effective role in contributing to the health of all peoples</li> 
<li>An Organization which pursues excellence; one that is effective, efficient, responsive, transparent and accountable (EBSS/2/2).</li>
</ul>
</P>
<p>In line with decision WHA65(9), the Director-General has submitted a report through the Executive Board 132 to the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly on the progress of the implementation of the  reform. The report along with other reform documents can be accessed through the following link:
