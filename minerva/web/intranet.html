    <p>
The Intranet XMart view allows you to explore some of the content held in our various XMart instances, ranging from the Global Health Observatory staging and public sites, to the Health Information System Refenrence database (HISRefDB), to departmental and unit sites such as for Dracunculiasis and HIV.

Information regarding browsing, searching, and downloading data from these repositories, including documentation for the download API so that you can include the data available here in your own work, is available under the Global Health Observatory's "About the Observatory" section.
