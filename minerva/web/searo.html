    <h1>Welcome to Regional Health Observatory for South East Asia</h1>
    <p>
This pilot version of the Regional Health Observatory (RHO) provides access to health related data of the South East Asian Region. The data on an extensive list of health indicators, including Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), can be browsed and downloaded by country and year.
    </p>
    <p>
RHO addresses the growing demand for health information at regional and country levels. It not only increases access to available data, but also stimulates future collection of complete, reliable and accurate data.
    </p>
    <p>
RHO integrates multiple datasets into a single, easy-to-use database. This enables comparisons between global estimates and nationally reported indicators and statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
In near future, the full-fledged RHO will offer more features and functionality to compare, analyze and visualize data and statistics using business intelligence software.
    </p>
    <p>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> Discrepancies between values in the Regional and the Global datasets may occur for the same indicator for the same reported period or year. Regional datasets represent the nationally reported values and regionally compiled estimates from various sources. Many of the Global datasets represent the best estimates of WHO using methodologies for specific indicators that aim for comparability across countries and time; they are updated as more recent or revised data become available, or when there are changes to the methodology being used. Therefore, indicators based on estimates in the Global datasets are not always the same as official national estimates or nationally reported values in the Regional database, although whenever possible we provide Member States the opportunity to review and comment on data and estimates.
