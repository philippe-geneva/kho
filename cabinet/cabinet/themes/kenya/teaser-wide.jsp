<br/>
The statistical review report on the performance of the Kenya health sector strategic plan (KHSSP) 2014–2018 is an important input into the overall mid-term review of the KHSSP. The report uses data from different sources including data from health management information system and household surveys to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of performance of the health sector in Kenya. The primary focus of the report is on the core indicators and targets of KHSSP 2014–2018. The report also pays special attention to additional indicators that help to assess progress towards achieving other national priorities and global goals that came into effect after development of the KHSSP.<br/>
