     <Description>
       <Display lang="en">
There were major increases in the use of ART among persons living with HIV (from 44% in 2013/14 to 62% in 2015/16) and antiretroviral for PMTCT (from 69 to 80%). BUT here are 1.6 million persons living with HIV, of which 700,000 are not on ART, and about 100,000 new infections still occur every year. Strong prevention efforts while maintaining and further increasing ART coverage will be critical.

     <Description>
       <Display lang="en">
Malaria parasite rates in children are down from 11% to 8%, driven by a decline from 37 to 28% in the Lake endemic zone. Malaria is now diagnosed in 17% of children under 5 taken to health clinics, compared to 27% four years earlier, and hospital mortality due to malaria is also declining. The use of long lasting insecticidal nets continued to increase and is high in endemic counties. However, malaria is still very high in the Lake zone and increased in the coastal endemic zone. Accelerating the increase of malaria intervention coverage in the endemic counties will be crucial

       <Display lang="en">
Between 2009 and 2015 the number of registered vehicles doubled from 1.2 to nearly 2.5 million. Based on the civil registration data this implies a modest increase in fatalities from 10 to 12 per 100,000 population, and decline in road fatalities by motorization levels. In 2015, there were 3,057 deaths or 12 fatalities per 100,000 population, and 22 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles. According to the NTSA data the most common victims were pedestrians (1,344 deaths or 44% of all fatalities), followed by vehicle drivers or passengers (33%), motor cycle riders or passengers (22%) and pedal cyclists (2%).
